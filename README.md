# phx-live-state

This is a package to help you build embedded micro-front-end applications. It connects to
a server running [live_state](https://github.com/gaslight/live_state) and sends events and receives state (and possibly other events). 

## Version compatibility

This version, 0.7.0, requires version 0.5.0 of later of the [`live_state` elixir library](https://github.com/gaslight/live_state) due to the addition of version tracking for state.

## Installation

```
npm install phx-live-state
```
